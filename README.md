# Intorduction : 
Tuiter is an excellent location to begin building self-confidence by putting our thoughts and ideas out into the world. On Tuiter, we may be motivated by following inspirational people or learn from world-class specialists on any subject. Our rendition of Tuiter includes an Explore and a Bookmarks feature too.Explore keeps you up to date on a variety of topics that have been specially selected for you. Tuiter uses this space to show you what's going on right now. Tuits may be saved in a timeline and accessed at any time via bookmarks. If both bookmarks and explore are enabled, the existing Tuiter application will gain a lot of value since users will be able to view popular hashtags, subjects, or updates that Tuiter believes you'll love the most based on your behavior.

# Flow of Application :
The Tuiter app mandates a user login if you want to use some of the implemented functionalities like bookmark, or liking a tuit. The user starts off by signing up or sigining in. We have created a simple login/signup page where the user can register himself/herself and then continue with the login. We have implemented a forgot password feature that ask's for your username and email and new password, if the application see's an entry with the given username and the given email address it will change the password for that particular account. After you login a session is created and the user can post tuits, like tuits posted by other users he or she follows on tuits. A user can follow other user. A user can also bookmark other user's tuit. The bookmarked tuits can be accessed separately by going to the bookmarks tab which can be accessed through the side navbar. A user can dislike and like other user's tuits as well. The profile section of the user contains all the tuits that he/she have made till date. There is also an Explore section where the user can find tuits from different user's that he/she might or might not follow. The explore section is for the user to explore different users based on his topic of interests such as sports, politiics etc.
